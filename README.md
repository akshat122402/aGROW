# aGROW (Global Resource for Organic Waste)
Small-scale farmers in India struggle to make a living due to low crop yields and lack of access to markets. Additionally, the use of chemical fertilizers has led to soil degradation and environmental pollution. On the other hand, there is a high demand for organic fertilizers in foreign countries, but the supply is limited.

We are working on a project named aGROW (Global Resource For Organic Waste) which aims to exports cow dung manure from local Indian farmers to foreign countries with a high demand for organic fertilizers. The supply chain involves purchasing, processing, packaging, and exporting the manure.
